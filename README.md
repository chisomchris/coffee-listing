<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/chisomchris/coffee-listing/blob/main/public/bg-cafe-lg.jpg?raw=true)

A simple coffee listing page built with Remix Run.

### What I learned

Working on this project, I was able to delve into the world of Remix Run, a full-stack web framework that allows you to build fast and scalable web applications with ease. I have gained a good understanding of the core concepts of Remix, including routing, data loading, and server-side rendering.

### Useful resources

- [Remix Tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/tutorial) -  This short tutorial helped me get started with Remix Run, easy to follow and very informative. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning the Remix concept and how to use it.

### Built with

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->
